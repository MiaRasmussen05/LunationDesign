                        This adorable German Shepherd couldn't stay in the box. It was to excited to jump out and meet
                        you. In this Greek blue colored box with nice interior, and sleek outside. Because nothing is to
                        good
                        for man's best friend. I love dogs and I wanted to share a bit of that love with you.
                        Therefore I made this adogable little sticker, for everyone who loves dogs.

                        This compass started as a fun little idea between friends, and then turned into something more.
                        With bright colors for all four directions but none for the compass and rose themselves. It was
                        meant to represent that even though the road you are on might seem grey, then there is always
                        colors to find if you start walking down a different path.

                        The Duckling is what started the sticker journey. A fun little doodle on piece of paper, that
                        then turned into a digital drawing. With a fun little pun and lots of colors. A little duckling
                        is so adorable and cute. The saying the prettiest of them all, just seemed to fit it. This one
                        might not have the most thought put into it, but it is special in its own way.

                        This sticker says it all by it self. So many people eat pizza every day, and I am no exception.
                        I
                        was shown a picture of a piece if pizza with glasses on. Could it get any more cool? I had to
                        make
                        my own design of it, because don't we all need to take it easy sometimes. It deserved to come to
                        life, and remind people to take it cheesy.

                        The fun play on the saying "what a smart cookie". Because both girls and boys can be smart
                        cookies.
                        But would the cookies really be smart without their glasses or would they just be adorable with
                        their small red and blue bows? I say the glasses definitely convince me they are smart, and
                        really
                        can you tell those small happy faces no?

                        keep us warm when everyone else have left? That is where this idea came from. Two small peas

                        make each other smile, just because they have each other. They also just had to have the cute
