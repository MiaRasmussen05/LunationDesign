      - On the browser firefox the buttons from the sticker page move one step to the right and leave the page.

   ### fixed bugs
   - ![Image of fixed text problem on sticker page](./READMEimages/fixed_text_problem.jpg)
      - On apple products the text on the sticker page moved to be up at the top from all the boxes becouse it was put in absolute position. This was fixed
      by removing absolut postion for the text information and put display inline-grid for all the whole sticker boxes. '
