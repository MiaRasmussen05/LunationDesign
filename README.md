## Testing

  - __Troubleshooting & peer code review__

    Testing have been going on thought out the building of this website. Using google dev tools to test and toubleshoot as I was going along with every step. Asking others to test out if it was easy to understand and follow the flow of the page.

  When I brought it up on slack for peer code review I got a few things back:
   - Wozza_5P pointed out to me that having the information box on sticker page wasn't the best user experince, that it seemed off having only 3 buttons and the rest having none.
   - Wozza_5P also pointed out that my 'only more questions?' box on the thanks page was hard to understand, and instead would be better with 'any more questions?'.
   - The same with the box for '48-72 hours', how it would be better to just choose one instead of having both of them on it.
   - Sean Finn also had a look over and pointed out a flow mistake in bottom of the last card on the sticker page. On the smaller screens it would stand on top of the footer when you where at the bottom instead of having some margin.

   ### Bugs
   - ![Image of not fixed button problem on sticker page apple products](./READMEimages/not_fixed_problem.jpg)
      - On apple products the button on the bottom of the sticker boxes move to the same position at the top of the page, when in position absolute. This however, I couldn't find a solution to.

      ![Image of not fixed button problem on sticker page on firefox](./READMEimages/Buttons_on_firefox.PNG)
      - On the browser firefox the buttons from the sticker page move one step to the right and leave the page.

   ### fixed bugs
   - ![Image of fixed text problem on sticker page](./READMEimages/fixed_text_problem.jpg)
      - On apple products the text on the sticker page moved to be up at the top from all the boxes becouse it was put in absolute position. This was fixed
      by removing absolut postion for the text information and put display inline-grid for all the whole sticker boxes. '
