                    <h2>Have you gotten no response?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are so sorry! We love to read your mails and hear your ideas. There is just not always enough
                        hours in a day. <br>
                        We believe each message deserves the same amount of time and care put into it, because you took
                        the time to write to us!
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h2>48 hours</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you haven't heard anything from us in over 48 hours on a work week, please do try and send
                        another message maybe it didn't go through the first time. <br>
                        However please do at least wait until the 48 hours have gone before sending it again, we will
                        get back to you as quickly as we can. Cross my heart!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Any more questions?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Do you feel the response you have gotten did not answer your question or only gave you more
                        questions, then please do contact us again. If this is the second time you are sending the same
                        message and you still haven't got the answer you are looking for then send us and email via
                        <span>LunationDesign05@gmail.com</span> and we can clear it up.
